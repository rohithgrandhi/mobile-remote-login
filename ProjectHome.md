You bought an application, using it for some time and suddenly now, you are facing some problems.
What will you do?
Going to carry your mobile all the way to the seller of your app??
Or Going to call that guy and ask for a solution and mend it for yourself?
Hmm.. Second one sounds a bit good Right?
But what if there is an application where the sellers support team can remotely log in to your mobile and solves the problem for you?
That is what the project aims!!
